This code was created to showcase the use of QML to make a new, rich UI for (The Butterfly Effect)[http://the-butterfly-effect.org].

The goals of this "spike":
 * learn how to use QT's QML
   * learn all about the new declarative approach
   * figure out the minimum Qt version needed
   * learn how to integrate C++ code and QML
   * use as little Javascript as possible
   * learn what's missing in QML and needs to be written custom
     * undo/redo
     * collision detection
 * prototype a new, simpler UI
 * validate ease-of-use with a few users

I'll leave it up to you to judge if the above succeeded.
